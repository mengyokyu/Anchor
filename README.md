# Anchor

**LSP for AI Agents** — Code intelligence that gives AI agents a structural map of your codebase.

> **v0.1.0-alpha** — Read-only. Write capabilities coming soon.

---

## Install

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://tharun-10dragneel.github.io/Anchor/install.sh | bash
```

Or build from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tharun-10Dragneel/Anchor.git
cd Anchor
cargo build --release
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the code graph for your project
anchor build

# See codebase structure
anchor overview

# Search for a symbol
anchor search "UserService"

# Get full context (code + dependencies + dependents)
anchor context "login"

# See what depends on a symbol
anchor deps "Config"

# Graph stats
anchor stats
```

---

## What is Anchor?

AI agents are good at *reasoning* about code, but bad at:
- Knowing the real structure of a codebase
- Finding symbols without grep spam
- Understanding relationships between files

**Anchor solves this.**

It builds a persistent graph of your codebase that agents can query instantly:
- Where is this symbol defined?
- What calls this function?
- What does this module depend on?

No guessing. No grep. Deterministic answers.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐     query      ┌─────────────┐
│   AI Agent  │ ─────────────▶ │   Anchor    │
│  (reasoning)│ ◀───────────── │   (graph)   │
└─────────────┘    context     └─────────────┘
```

1. `anchor build` — Parses your code with tree-sitter, builds a graph
2. Agent queries via CLI or MCP
3. Anchor returns structural facts (not semantic guesses)

## Supported Languages

- Rust
- Python
- JavaScript
- TypeScript / TSX

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `anchor build` | Build/rebuild the code graph |
| `anchor overview` | Show codebase structure |
